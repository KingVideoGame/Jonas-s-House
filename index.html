                You've arrived home from your last day of school, and can't wait to collapse
                on your bed. Unfortunately, your mischevious brother, Jonas, has transformed 
                the house into a maze of escape rooms while you were away. Fortunately, he 
                accidentally left hints on how to escape each room. Use the arrow keys to move.
                Press A to pick things up. Find hints. Get your bedroom back. And try not to
                have an epic boss battle with Jonas, because that would be a pain in the butt to code.
