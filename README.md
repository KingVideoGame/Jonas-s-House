Welcome to Jonas's House, a puzzle/adventure video game filled with hidden nooks, Easter eggs, and boss battles! The game centers around teenager Ethan, who has just arrived home from
the last day of school and can't wait to collapse on his bed. To his horror, his brother Jonas has transformed the house into a maze of escape rooms to get back at Ethan for a prank he
did a few weeks earlier. The worst part? The escape rooms have no way out! ...Or do they? Use the arrow keys to move around. Find hints and buttons that will lead you out of each room.
Get past Jonas's henchmen, fight Jonas in a 1v1 boss battle, and win back your bedroom!
